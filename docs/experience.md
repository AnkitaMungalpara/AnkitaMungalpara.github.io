## Graduate Research Assistant
_University of Massachusetts – Dartmouth_, USA

**Jan 2025 – Present**

- Developed a <span class="text-purple-100">medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) pipeline</span> by performing <span class="text-purple-100">supervised fine-tuning on the AlphaCLIP + LLaVA-Med multimodal model (with 7.57 billion parameters)</span>, using the PEFT technique. 

- Trained a <span class="text-purple-100">CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training) multi-modal model from scratch</span>: developed vision and text encoders, integrated Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), applied contrastive loss, and deployed the model using Gradio.

- <span class="text-purple-100">Fine-tuned the Mistral-7B model</span> on 75,000 financial news samples using the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique, and utilized Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.



## R&D Data Science Intern, Generative AI
_Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine_, USA

**Jun 2024 – Aug 2024**

- Developed a <span class="text-purple-100">conversational agent using LangChain, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</span>, advanced prompt design, and memory-aware chain components.

- Integrated <span class="text-purple-100">Weaviate for vector search, with sematic routing and prompt-tuning</span>.  

- Enhanced answer accuracy by 65% and cut response latency from days to <1 sec. 

- Delivered <span class="text-purple-100">oral presentation at the 2024 J&J Global Intern Research Symposium—selected as 1 of 14 presenters among 85 interns</span>.


## Senior Analyst - Machine Learning Engineer
_Tiger Analytics_, India

**Feb 2022 – Jul 2023**

- Designed a <span class="text-purple-100">computer vision pipeline for oral video analysis using Azure ML + Databricks</span>, slashing processing time by 70%.  

- <span class="text-purple-100">Built a Label Studio-annotation pipeline</span>, reducing manual effort by 65% and deployment via Azure ML.


## Data Scientist
_BlueReef Technology_, India

**Aug 2020 – Jan 2022**

- Developed an <span class="text-purple-100">end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution by integrating Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as S3, Lambda, Transcribe, and SageMaker</span> to process over 100 hours of audio content, thereby automating text analysis and reducing processing time by 75%.

- <span class="text-purple-100">Implemented a sensor-based activity prediction model to process over 10 million data points</span> collected from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. 

- <span class="text-purple-100">Designed advanced feature engineering techniques</span>, including statistical measures and temporal pattern extraction.


## Research Intern
_Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)_, India

**May 2019 – Jul 2020**

- <span class="text-purple-100">Developed PolInSAR techniques: Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) forward model + Three‑Stage Inversion model</span> to estimate forest stand height.  

- <span class="text-purple-100">Achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.05 m</span> for the Saipung Reserve Forest in northeastern India, located in Meghalaya.

- <span class="text-purple-100">Published work in Springer and presented at the 3<sup>rd</sup> conference of the Arabian Journal of Geosciences 2020, Sousse, Tunisia.</span>
