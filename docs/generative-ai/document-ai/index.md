This series explores modern approaches to Document Intelligence, highlighting how advanced models can extract structured information directly from complex documents. From scientific papers to invoices and receipts, we look at tools and techniques that go beyond traditional OCR to deliver smarter, end-to-end understanding.

<!-- To make it as easy as possible to write documentation in plain Markdown, most UI components are styled using default Markdown elements with few additional CSS classes needed. -->
<!-- In this section, I explore the inner workings of LangChain for building systems with Large Language Models (LLMs). The projects cover integration with both OpenAI and Hugging Face models, demonstrating hands-on experience with chat models and conversational prompting.
