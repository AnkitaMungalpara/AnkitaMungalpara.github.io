This section presents hands-on projects that explore the design, fine-tuning, and application of generative models across text and vision. These projects jump into the practical workings of modern generative systems. You'll also find real-world applications, emphasizing end-to-end pipelines, customization, and performance optimization.

<!-- This section highlights projects that harness the power of Generative AIâ€”spanning text, image, and multimodal generation. From fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to building vision-language systems and conversational agents, these projects demonstrate how generative models can synthesize content, automate tasks, and enable intelligent human-AI interaction across domains. -->

<!-- This section showcases hands-on projects that explore the design, fine-tuning, and application of generative models across text and vision. From building CLIP and LLMs from scratch to fine-tuning large models like Mistral-7B with LoRA, these projects delve into the practical workings of modern generative systems. You'll also find real-world applications using LangChain for LLM orchestration and Hugging Face for natural language processing, emphasizing end-to-end pipelines, customization, and performance optimization. -->
