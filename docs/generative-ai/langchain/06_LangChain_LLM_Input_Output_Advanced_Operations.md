<!-- **Enter API Tokens**


```python
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = OPENAI_API_KEY
``` -->

**Chat Models and LLMs**

_Accessing Commercial LLMs like ChatGPT_


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# instantiate the model
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
    temperature=0
)
```

## Tracking LLM Costs

Usually, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT charge based on the number of tokens used per request and response. Tokens are essentially chunks of text, and the cost is calculated based on how many tokens are processed in a given interaction. You can track your token usage for specific API calls to manage and optimize your costs effectively.

Currently, this tracking feature is only implemented for the OpenAI API, allowing users to monitor and control their token consumption more precisely.


```python
from langchain_community.callbacks import get_openai_callback
```


```python
prompt = """Explain Deep Learning in one sentence"""

with get_openai_callback() as callback:
  response = llm.invoke(prompt)
  print(response.content)
  print(callback)
```
```
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems by learning from large amounts of data.
Tokens Used: 41
    Prompt Tokens: 14
    Completion Tokens: 27
Successful Requests: 1
Total Cost (USD): $7.500000000000001e-05
```


```python
print(callback.total_tokens)
```

```
41
```



```python
print(callback.prompt_tokens, callback.completion_tokens)
```

```
(14, 27)
```


```python
print(callback.total_cost)
```


```
7.500000000000001e-05
```


## Caching in LangChain

LangChain includes an optional caching layer for language model APIs (LLMs), offering significant benefits in terms of cost efficiency and performance improvement.

* **Cost Efficiency**:
    - The caching feature helps reduce the number of API calls made to LLM providers. By storing responses, you can avoid repeatedly requesting the same completions.
    - This is particularly advantageous for applications that frequently make identical requests, as it can substantially lower operational costs.

* **Performance Improvement**:
    - Caching can greatly enhance your application's speed by minimizing the need for repeated API calls to the LLM provider.
    - With cached responses readily available, interactions become faster and more efficient, leading to a smoother user experience and quicker processing times.


Overall, LangChain's caching layer is a valuable feature for optimizing both the cost and performance of applications using language model APIs.

## Streaming in LLMs


All language model interfaces (LLMs) in LangChain implement the `Runnable` interface, which provides a set of default methods, including `ainvoke`, `batch`, `abatch`, `stream`, and `astream`. This comprehensive setup ensures that all LLMs are equipped with basic streaming capabilities, facilitating both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

**Streaming Defaults**

- **Synchronous Streaming**:
   - By default, synchronous streaming operations return an `Iterator` that yields a single value, representing the final result from the LLM provider.
   - This approach allows for efficient processing of responses in a sequential manner.

- **Asynchronous Streaming**:
   - Similarly, asynchronous streaming operations default to returning an `AsyncIterator` that also yields the final result.
   - This method supports non-blocking operations, enabling the handling of multiple tasks concurrently and improving overall performance in applications requiring real-time interactions.


This standardized interface and default behavior streamline the implementation of various language models within LangChain, ensuring consistency and ease of use across different streaming scenarios.


```python
prompt = """one advantage of distributed computing in one line"""
template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt)

# streaming response
for chunk in llm.stream(template.format()):
    print(chunk.content)

```

Distributed computing is a computing paradigm in which multiple computers work together on a task, sharing resources and processing power to achieve a common goal. In a distributed computing system, tasks are divided into smaller sub-tasks and distributed among multiple computers, often referred to as nodes or servers. These nodes communicate with each other over a network to coordinate their efforts and share information.
One of the key advantages of distributed computing is its ability to harness the collective power of multiple computers to solve complex problems more quickly and efficiently than a single computer could on its own. By distributing the workload among multiple nodes, distributed computing systems can handle larger volumes of data and perform computations at a faster rate.
There are several different models of distributed computing, including client-server architecture, peer-to-peer networks, and grid computing. In a client-server architecture, one or more central servers coordinate the activities of multiple client computers, which request and receive services from the server. In a peer-to-peer network, all nodes have equal status and can communicate directly with each other to share resources and information. Grid computing involves connecting multiple computers across different locations to form a virtual supercomputer, enabling large-scale computations and data processing.
Distributed computing is used in a wide range of applications, including scientific research, data analysis, financial modeling, and cloud computing. It offers scalability, fault tolerance, and high performance, making it a valuable tool for organizations looking to leverage the power of multiple computers to solve complex problems.
