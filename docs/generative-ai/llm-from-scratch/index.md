This section describes my ongoing journey of building a Large Language Model from scratch. I'm currently working through the core stages—dataset preprocessing, tokenization, architecture design, and setting up training pipelines. This hands-on project is helping me dive deep into the inner workings of transformers, language modeling objectives, and model scaling. 
As I progress, I aim to get a thorough understanding of what drives today’s generative AI systems.
