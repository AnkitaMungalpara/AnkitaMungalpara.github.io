# All Projects

Welcome! This is a collection of my hands-on projects in agentic AI, generative AI, computer vision, and MLOps. Each project delves into a key concept or framework in AI and ML, often supported by practical implementations or tutorials.

## Agentic AI
- [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](../agentic-ai/2025-04-05-mcp/index.html)
- [Managing Memory, Context, and State in an AI Agent](../agentic-ai/memory_context_in_agent/index.html)


## Generative AI
- [Building CLIP From Scratch](../generative-ai/2025-02-21-clip-from-scratch/index.html)
- [Fine-Tune Mistral-7B Model with LoRA](../generative-ai/2025-04-05-finetune-with-lora/index.html)
- [Fine-Tune Mistral-7B Model with QLoRA](../generative-ai/finetune-with-qlora/index.html)
- [LLM From Scratch](../generative-ai/llm-from-scratch/index.html)
- [Generative AI with LangChain](../generative-ai/langchain/index.html)
- [NLP with Hugging Face](../generative-ai/nlp-with-huggingface/index.html)

## Computer Vision
- [YOLOv5 Custom Object Detection](../computer-vision/yolo-object-detection/index.html)

## MLOps
